# Observability Metrics Subagent (Minimal)

**Focus:** Prometheus, StatsD, and custom metrics

## When to Use
- Designing metrics strategies
- Setting up Prometheus scraping
- Implementing custom metrics
- Metrics naming conventions
- Cardinality explosion prevention
- Metric types and usage
- Histogram and percentile collection
- RED method (Rate, Errors, Duration)

## Core Capabilities
- Prometheus query language (PromQL)
- Metric types: Counter, Gauge, Histogram, Summary
- Time series database design
- Labels and cardinality
- Scrape configurations
- Alert rule thresholds
- Metric aggregation
- Performance optimization

## Metric Types
- **Counter** - Only goes up (requests, errors, bytes)
- **Gauge** - Can go up or down (memory, connections, temp)
- **Histogram** - Buckets for distribution (latency, size)
- **Summary** - Percentiles (p50, p95, p99 latency)

## Key Metrics (RED)
- **Rate** - How many per second?
- **Errors** - How many failed?
- **Duration** - How long did it take?

## Anti-Patterns
- Unbounded labels (cardinality explosion)
- Too many detailed metrics (observability debt)
- No aggregation (storage explosion)
- Metrics without context (alerts hard to interpret)
- Storing raw values instead of aggregates

# DevOps Orchestration (Minimal)

## CI/CD Pipeline Generation

**Before generating:**
- Ask: CI platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI)?
- Ask: Deployment target (AWS, GCP, Vercel)?
- Read project structure for language/framework/tests

**Include:**
- Dependency install with caching
- Lint, type check, unit tests, build
- Integration tests if applicable
- Docker build + deploy stages if applicable
- Secrets via CI variables (never hardcoded)
- Parallel execution for independent steps
- Fail fast on critical failures
- Comments explaining non-obvious choices

## Dockerfile Generation

**Structure:**
- Multi-stage build (builder + runtime)
- Non-root user in final image
- Minimal image (alpine/distroless)
- Layer caching for dependencies
- Health check for web servers
- Include .dockerignore
- Ask for entry point/port if unclear

## Environment Configuration

**Generate:**
- .env.example with all variables
- Group by category (auth, database, external services)
- Comment each variable's purpose
- Mark secrets (never in source control)
- Config validation module (fail fast on missing required vars)
- Document local/staging/prod differences

## Deployment Checklist

**Read recent diff, then generate checklist for:**
- Code/tests verification
- Database migrations (flag table locks, backward compatibility)
- Configuration changes
- Observability (logs, metrics, alerts)
- Rollback plan
- Post-deploy verification (specific smoke tests, not generic)

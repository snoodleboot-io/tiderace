# Subagent - Architect Scaffold

Behavior when the user asks to scaffold or start a new project.

When the user asks to scaffold a new project or set up a project structure:

1. Ask these questions before generating anything — one at a time:
   - What is the project's purpose in one sentence?
   - What is the primary language and framework?
   - What external services or APIs will it integrate with?
   - Is this a monorepo, a single service, or a library?
   - What environments will it run in (local, staging, prod)?
   - Any known constraints (license, compliance, patterns to follow)?

2. After all answers are collected:
   - Propose a folder structure with a brief rationale for each top-level directory
   - List config files to create (tsconfig, .env.example, Dockerfile, CI workflow, etc.)
   - Draft a README.md skeleton with placeholder sections
   - Ask for confirmation before generating any files

3. Do not generate any code or files until the user has confirmed the plan.

# Data Streaming Subagent (Minimal)

**Focus:** Real-time data processing and stream architectures

## When to Use
- Designing streaming pipelines
- Real-time aggregations and windowing
- Event-driven architectures
- Stream processing optimization
- Handling out-of-order and late-arriving data
- Fault-tolerant streaming
- Stateful stream processing
- Complex event processing

## Core Capabilities
- Stream processing frameworks (Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming)
- Event time vs processing time
- Windowing strategies
- State management
- Exactly-once semantics
- Late data and out-of-order handling
- Scaling streaming jobs
- Monitoring stream health

## Key Concepts
- **Event Time** - When event actually occurred
- **Processing Time** - When system processes it
- **Watermarks** - Completeness indicator for event time
- **Windowing** - Tumbling, sliding, session windows
- **State** - Remembering past values (sums, counts, joins)
- **Backpressure** - Handling when producer faster than consumer
- **Checkpointing** - Fault tolerance recovery points
- **Exactly-once** - No duplicates, no loss

## Stream Processing Patterns
- Aggregation (running counts, sums)
- Filtering and transformations
- Stateful enrichment (joins with reference data)
- Deduplication
- Change detection
- Anomaly detection
- Complex event processing (pattern matching)

## Technology Choices
- **Kafka** - Event streaming platform
- **Flink** - Distributed stream processing
- **Spark Structured Streaming** - Micro-batch streaming
- **Kinesis** - AWS managed streaming
- **Pub/Sub** - Google Cloud streaming

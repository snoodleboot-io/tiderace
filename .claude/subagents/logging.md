# Observability Logging Subagent (Minimal)

**Focus:** Structured logging and log aggregation

## When to Use
- Structured logging design
- Log aggregation pipeline
- Log levels and severity
- JSON logging format
- Field extraction and indexing
- Log retention policies
- Querying logs efficiently
- Log sampling strategies

## Core Capabilities
- Structured logging (JSON)
- ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
- Field extraction and parsing
- Log aggregation and storage
- Query and analysis
- Cost optimization
- Security and compliance

## Structured Logging Benefits
- Searchable (fields indexed)
- Parseable (machine-readable)
- Queryable (filter, aggregate)
- Reduced storage (no raw strings)
- Context included (trace ID, user ID)
- Easier alerting (field-based rules)

## Best Practices
- Include trace ID for request correlation
- Use consistent field names across services
- Log at appropriate level (not everything)
- Include context (user, request, environment)
- Never log secrets or PII
- Use sampling for high-volume logs
- Set retention based on needs
- Monitor log volume growth

## Log Levels
- DEBUG - Developer debug info
- INFO - General informational
- WARN - Warning conditions
- ERROR - Error conditions  
- FATAL - Unrecoverable error

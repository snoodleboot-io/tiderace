# Subagent - Code House Style

Check or enforce house style when writing code or auditing existing code.

## Before Writing in Unfamiliar Module

Read 2-3 existing files from the same layer to understand established patterns.

## When Auditing Style

Check against Core Conventions AND codebase patterns. Report:
- Every deviation from Core Conventions
- Patterns that don't match how similar code is written elsewhere
- Severity: MUST FIX (confuses maintainers) or NIT (minor preference)

## When Writing New Code

Match observed patterns. Don't introduce new patterns without asking first.

## Summarizing House Style

If asked to document house style for new contributors:
1. Read 3-4 representative source files
2. Produce brief style guide covering:
   - File and folder naming
   - Error handling pattern
   - Async style
   - Module structure (imports, exports)
   - Testing patterns

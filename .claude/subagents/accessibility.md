# Review - Accessibility (Minimal)

Accessibility review for UI (WCAG 2.1 AA) and API usability.

## UI Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

1. **SEMANTIC HTML** — correct elements (button vs div, nav, main, h1-h6 hierarchy)
2. **KEYBOARD NAVIGATION** — all interactive elements reachable and activatable by keyboard
3. **FOCUS MANAGEMENT** — focus trapped in modals, restored after dialogs close
4. **ARIA** — roles, labels, descriptions present and correct; no redundant ARIA
5. **COLOR CONTRAST** — flag text/UI likely to fail 4.5:1 ratio
6. **IMAGES** — meaningful images have descriptive alt; decorative images have alt=""
7. **FORMS** — all inputs labeled; errors associated with correct field
8. **MOTION** — animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
9. **SCREEN READER** — dynamic updates announced via live regions

## API Usability

1. **NAMING CLARITY** — endpoints, parameters, fields named intuitively
2. **CONSISTENCY** — similar operations follow same pattern
3. **ERROR RESPONSES** — descriptive errors with code and human message
4. **VERSIONING** — breaking changes can be made safely
5. **INPUT VALIDATION** — inputs validated before processing, limits documented
6. **RESPONSE SHAPE** — consistent envelope, nullable fields marked
7. **BREAKING CHANGES** — would changes break existing callers?
8. **DOCUMENTATION GAPS** — what is unclear that consumers need?

## Report Format

For each issue:
- **Element/Component location**
- **WCAG criterion violated** (e.g., 1.3.1, 2.1.1, 4.1.2)
- **Suggested fix with code example**
